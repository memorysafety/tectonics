SUMMARY:Tectonics by Prossimo
URL:https://tectonics.memorysafety.org
DESCRIPTION:A big shift towards memory safety\n\nIn relatively short order, the topic of memory safety has gained momentum from being viewed as an unrealistic endeavor to one that is being solved. Join ISRG as it brings together a small group of leaders paving the way towards a more memory safe Internet.\n\nIn a day-long convening, practitioners, technical leaders, and policy-makers will gather to dive into a 2.0 conversation about improving memory safety, moving beyond the basic issues of its importance to focus on how we can get to a more memory safe future, faster. Working group discussion topics will include:\n\n- Adoption of memory safe languages in operating systems\n- Dependency management \n- Organizational roadmaps for deploying memory safe software\n\nThrough proctored conversations, the end result of Tectonics will be clear and actionable recommendations that Prossimo will publish and distribute.\n\nHotel Kabuki, 1625 Post Street\, San Francisco\, California 94115
