In relatively short order, the topic of memory safety has gained momentum from being viewed as an unrealistic endeavor to one that is being solved. Join ISRG as it brings together a small group of leaders paving the way towards a more memory safe Internet.

In a day-long convening, practitioners, technical leaders, and policy-makers will gather to dive into a 2.0 conversation about improving memory safety, moving beyond the basic issues of its importance to focus on how we can get to a more memory safe future, faster. Working group discussion topics will include:

<ul class='type-hero-description'>
<li>Facilitating adoption of memory safe code for Internet critical infrastructure</li>
<li>Memory safety roadmaps for organizations</li>
<li>Facilitating the inclusion of Rust in operating systems</li>
<li>Improving trust in Rust dependency trees</li>
</ul>

Through proctored conversations, the end result of Tectonics will be clear and actionable recommendations that Prossimo will publish and distribute.

We’re taking an approach intended to foster the most productive possible discussions about various topics we’ve set forth.

The people we’re gathering are, with few or no exceptions, already familiar with the basics of memory safety and the conversation around it. We will not rehash the basics, instead we will focus on moving the conversation forward. Moderators will start each track with pre-populated notes covering many of the basics so we can iterate and improve on previous discussions.

Participants will rank track options in order of preference in advance of the convening, primarily so that participation in each track can be balanced and of manageable size. A primary and secondary track will be assigned day-of.

Each track will be structured around a set of questions and prompts. When track discussion time starts, participants will go to the table for their track.

Each track will have a moderator. The moderator will keep the group on track, select speakers, and ensure equitable speaking time.

Each track will also have a note taker. The note taker will be building an outline for a final report during the discussion. This outline will be visible to all participants on a screen.

In the weeks after the event, the reports from each track will be completed and published via a blog post. Their contents will be used to help guide the development and adoption of memory safe software industry-wide, including Prossimo’s work going forward.

#### Facilitating adoption of memory safe code for Internet critical infrastructure
Leaders: Alex Gaynor, Paul Kehrer

* How can we facilitate the adoption of memory safe code for the Internet’s critical infrastructure?
* What issues might deployments of TLS, DNS, NTP, BGP, and web-facing servers and proxies face, and how can we alleviate them?

#### Memory safety roadmaps for organizations
Leaders: Bob Lord, Eric Mill

* What should memory safety roadmaps for organizations look like?
* How can we convince companies to produce them?
* Who should sign them and what kind of accountability should be involved?

#### Facilitating the inclusion of Rust in operating systems
Leaders: Sudhi Herle, Arlie Davis

* How can we facilitate the adoption of Rust packages in operating systems?
* What issues might operating systems like Linux distributions, Windows, and Android face, and how can we alleviate them?

#### Improving trust in Rust dependency trees
Leaders: Dirkjan Ochtman, Florian Gilcher

* Rust has large dependency trees that necessitate trusting too many different maintainers.
* Can we find ways to make trusting dependencies easier?
* Can we reduce the size of dependency trees?
