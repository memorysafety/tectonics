In relatively short order, the topic of memory safety has gained momentum from being an “objectively crazy” problem to one that is being solved. Join ISRG as it brings together a small group of leaders paving the way towards a more memory safe Internet.

In a day-long convening, practitioners, policy-makers, and technical leaders will gather to not only discuss a range of topics related to accelerating memory safety, but will use structured time to set a clear, actionable path for moving our work forward.
